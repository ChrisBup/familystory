## FamilyStory

## Research/Concept

FamilyStory is a social network but one meant to allow family members to share the stories that all families have, all in one place. It uses collective wisdom to build a narrative history that emerges from individuals contributing their own memories in their own words to share with each other and generations to come. This is the record of a family and a way to connect - over time and space - with those who mean the most.

Hopefully, it will persist and future generations will be able get a glimpse of where they came from and the people who came before them. It's a small way to create a broad picture of a family and its story.

Welcome to the family!

## How it Works

FamilyStory allows users to create a profile as a family member with their information and record a video introduction where they answer questions about themselves and share their favorite stories about their family. They can also comment on any other family member's profile.
